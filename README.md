# reflex-aws-detect-security-group-open-ingress
A Reflex rule for detecting EC2 Security Groups with open ingress allowed.

To learn more about EC2 Security Groups, see [the AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html).

## Getting Started
To get started using Reflex, check out [the Reflex Documentation](https://docs.cloudmitigator.com/).

## Usage
To use this rule either add it to your `reflex.yaml` configuration file:  
```
rules:
  aws:
  - detect-security-group-open-ingress:
      version: latest
```

or add it directly to your Terraform:  
```
module "detect-security-group-open-ingress" {
  source            = "git::https://github.com/cloudmitigator/reflex-aws-detect-security-group-open-ingress.git?ref=latest"
  sns_topic_arn     = module.central-sns-topic.arn
  reflex_kms_key_id = module.reflex-kms-key.key_id
}
```

Note: The `sns_topic_arn` and `reflex_kms_key_id` example values shown here assume you generated resources with `reflex build`. If you are using the Terraform on its own you need to provide your own valid values.

## Configuration
This rule has no configuration options.
